Welcome to my repository of various Python Projects. Most of them are simple projects created for educational purposes or to test out different features. See below details for each of them.

# Birdgame

The most complex program I've created and the one I've put the most time and energy into is a game where you can buy birds, train birds, name your birds, teach them new tricks, sell eggs, have your birds fight other birds, and enroll your birds in talent shows where they can win generous prizes. It uses a .csv file for save data which it can import or erase on subsequent runs. It's quite fun despite becoming incredibly unbalanced after a while. There are also some cute Easter eggs.

# Calculator

A calculator for basic math operations, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponent (^), percentage (%), and parentheses up to {}.

# Chatbot

It's supposed to be a chatbot running OpenAI model GPT-3.5 but unfortunately it does not work. Keeps returning rate limit error.

# EmotionalStoryGen

Creates a local URL to upload an image. The output will be a wholesome caption tailored to the upload, generated using GPT-2. The output is sometimes very endearing.

# ImageCaptionGen

A more primitive version of the previous program. Asks for a local image path and returns an objective description. However, it's not good at recognizing cities, as it confidently mistook Bucharest for Kyiv and Aarhus for Trondheim.

# MovieFinder

Uses the OMDb API to provide information about the movie provided (or the closest results).

# Sphere

One of my first projects. You put in the radius of a sphere and it calculates the volume. You can use units of measurement in your prompt (m, ft, km, etc.) and it will return the appropriate measurement unit for volume.

# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe with adjustable difficulty and player colors. The default difficulty is 5/5 (Impossible) which is supposed to be impossible to beat. If you manage to beat this setting, please send to me the move sequence so I can look into it for patching. For casual play difficulties 1 to 3 work best.

# Weather

Uses the Weather API to provide weather data for any city provided, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. Each weather condition has an emoji.
